mono-reactive aims to provide Reactive Extension (Rx) [*1] features to the
Mono world.

Right now it is almost about System.Reactive.dll implementation, but I'm
looking forward to seeing it running ReativeUI [*2] for iOS as well as
Mono for Android support.

System.Reactive.dll is feature complete, but there is a couple of things that
are known to fail. Also I'm still newbie in Rx land, there are likely
stupid implementation and nasty hacks. 
Patches, bug reports and/or any feedback are welcome.

** Rx2 support

All the existing 1.0-based API (in System.Reactive.dll) is mapped to new Rx2
assemblies (System.Reactive.*.dll). Some of them were however, turned into
NotImplemented state as they depended on types that are now "external" from
the implementing assembly.
